# React Native Setup

## [Getting Started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## What is React Native ?

- React Native is a framework for building apps that work on both Android and iOS.
- It allows you to create real native apps using JavaScript and React.
- This differs from frameworks like Cordova, where you use HTML to build the UI, which will then just be displayed within the device’s integrated mobile browser (WebView). React Native has built-in components which are compiled to native UI components, while your JavaScript code is executed through a virtual machine.
- This makes React Native more performant than Cordova.

## What is EXPO ?

- Expo allows you to build React Native apps without the initial headache that comes with setting up your development environment.
- It only requires you to have Node installed on your machine, and the Expo client app on your device or emulator.
- Expo is actually a platform that gives you access to tools, libraries and services for building Android and iOS apps faster with React Native.
- Expo comes with an SDK which includes most of the APIs you can ask for in a mobile app development platform:
  - Camera
  - ImagePicker
  - Facebook
  - GoogleSignIn
  - Location
  - MapView
  - Permissions
  - Push Notifications
  - Video

## Setting Up the React Native Development Environment

- Step1 -> Install Node
- step2 -> install react native expo **npm install -g expo-cli**
- Step3 -> Next, install Yarn, the preferred package manager for Expo: **npm install -g yarn**

## we can use create-react-native-app or expo to create react native app

## Create App using expo command

- expo init appName
- npm start or yarn start
- to add api yarn add pokemon axios

## Using cl

- npx react-native init [PROJECT-NAME]
- react-native init [PROJECT-NAME] --package=com.organization.project.app
- npx react-native@latest init MyProject --package-name com.myproject.app (latest React V)
- cd [PROJECT-NAME]
- npx react-native run-android
- npx react-native run-ios
- npx react-native build-android
- npx react-native build-ios
- npx react-native link [LIBRARY-NAME] ( Link dependencies to native projects )
- watchman watch-del-all (If something don’t run as expected, maybe you need to clear and create a new bundle with this command.)
- To Start Metro - npm start
- To Run in IOS - npm run ios

# React Native Set up from scrach
- There are 2 ways you can set up react native app for mobile
- 1. Using react native cli
- 2. Using react native expo

## Basic commands for React Native
- Install Jaja 1.8
- Set up java home if you are using Windows laptop
- Install Python 2
- Install Android Studio (For React Native android)
- Install Xcode (For React Native IOS)

## React Native Commands
- npm install -g react-native-cli
- react-native init DemoProject (You can name your project as anything)
- npx react-native init AwesomeProject
- react-native run-android (To run in android device)
- react-native run-ios (To run in ios Device)
- npx react-native run-ios


## Web Setup
- npm install react-dom react-native-web
- npm install react-dom react-native-web --legacy-peer-deps
- npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-native-web (Babel Plugin for build time optimization)
- npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver  (Babel Module Aliasing)

## Metro
- Metro is a JavaScript bundler which takes in options, an entry file, and gives you a JavaScript file including all JavaScript files back. 
- Every time you run a react native project, a compilation of many javascript files are done into a single file. 
- This compilation is done by a bundler which is called Metro.

## Integration with Existing App [Click here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps)

- Set up directory structure
  - To ensure a smooth experience, create a new folder for your integrated React Native project, then copy your existing Android project to an /android subfolder.
- Install JavaScript dependencies
- Go to the root directory for your project and create a new package.json file with the following contents:

```
{
  "name": "MyReactNativeApp",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-native start"
  }
}
```

- Next, install the react and react-native packages. Open a terminal or command prompt, then navigate to the directory with your package.json file and run:
- npm install react-native
- npm install react@version_printed_above
- Adding React Native to your app

## React Native Project using TypeScript

- Add to existing project
  - npm install -D @tsconfig/react-native @types/jest @types/react @types/react-test-renderer typescript
- Create new project with Typescript
  - npx react-native init YourProjectName --template react-native-template-typescript

## Expo Vs React Native cli
- Expo Cli/Tool
    - Its a 3rd party Service(Free)
    - Managed app development
    - Lots of convenience & Utility Features : Simplifies Development
    - But you are limited to the expo ecosystem.
- React Native Cli
    - By react Native team/ community
    - BAre-bone Development (ONly a basic setup)
    - Almost no convenience or utility feature
    - Full flexibility : Integrate with any NAtive Code

## Install NOde JS

## Expo setup
- npm install expo-cli --global
- expo init myprojectname
- It will ask some questions like, type of app, package name etc
- npm start (It will start the app by opening a window in Browser)
## For React Native Cli
- npm install -g react-native-cli
- react-native init ProjectName
- react-native run-android
- react-native run-ios
