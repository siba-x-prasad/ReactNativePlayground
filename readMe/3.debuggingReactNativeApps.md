## Console
- So far, the most convenient way to troubleshoot an issue is to backtrace data utilizing consoles throughout the execution cycle. 
- This is one of the most effective options if your problem involves some modest data manipulation and you are unsure of how a certain operation will turn out.
```
console.log   ('Prints .toString() representation of Value') 
console.warn  ('Prints values as yellow warning') ‚ö†Ô∏è
console.error ('Prints values as red error') üõë
console.table ('Prints values based on index')
console.dir   ('Displays interactive list of the properties')
```
## 2. Inspect Elements
- Inspect Elements can be triggered using the developer menu on Android and iOS, and it can be considered a go-to option to debug UI elements.
- **Inspect:** It provides a selection-based tool that displays the props and style objects applied to the selected element. You can look at the dimensions, CSS, margin, padding, font size, font family, etc.
- Network: It provides you with the network call details like type, method, URL, requestHeaders, responseContentType, responseSize, responseHeaders, status, timeout, response, responseURL, etc.
## 3. Debugging using VS Code
- VS Code inherently doesn‚Äôt support debugging in React Native.
- Just go to the Extensions tab and install ‚ÄúReact Native Tools‚Äù. In the Run & Debug Tab, select ‚ÄúCreate a launch.json file‚Äù. 
- Then, add configuration for your Android and iOS apps, and you‚Äôre good to go.
