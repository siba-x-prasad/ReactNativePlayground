# Component

- [Components](https://reactnative.dev/docs/0.71/intro-react-native-components)

## Hooks

- Hooks are great for stateful logic and code organization. Now we have several hooks for common use cases:
- [useNavigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation/)
- [useRoute](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-route/)
- [useNavigationState](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-navigation-state/)
- [useFocusEffect](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-focus-effect/)
- [useIsFocused](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-is-focused/)
- [useScrollToTop](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/use-scroll-to-top/)

## Component life cycle

- All React class components have their own phases. When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM, it gets properties, orprops, and from now on they can be accessed using this.props.
- Then the whole lifecycle ‘thing’ begins.
- Note: A React component may NOT go through all of the phases. The component could get mounted and unmounted the next minute — without any updates or error handling.
- A component’s lifecycle can be divided into 4 parts:
- **Mounting** —  an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.
- **Updating** — when the React component is born in the browser and grows by receiving new updates.
- **Unmounting** — the component is not needed and gets unmounted.
- **Error handling** — called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.

## Lifecycle Phases

- As I have introduced the basic idea of each phase, let’s take a closer look at their methods.

## Mounting

- These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
- **constructor()**
- **static getDerivedStateFromProps()**
- **render()**
- **componentDidMount()**

## Updating

- An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is re-rendered:
- **static getDerivedStateFromProps()**
- **shouldComponentUpdate()**
- **render()**
- **getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()**
- **componentDidUpdate()**

## Unmounting

- This method is called when a component is removed from the DOM:
- **componentWillUnmount()**

## Error Handling

- These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.
- **static getDerivedStateFromError()**
- **componentDidCatch()**
- Now that we know what are the lifecycle phases and their methods, we can get down to the next part — a detailed description of each method.

# Detailed Lifecycle

## Mounting

## Constructor()

- First of all, the constructor method is called before mounting to the DOM and rendering.
- Usually, you’d initialize state and bind event handler methods within the constructor method.
- This is the first part of the lifecycle and is only called when it is explicitly declared, so there is no need to declare it in every component you create.
- If you need to make any side-effects or subscriptions in this method, you should use componentDidMount().
- I will introduce it later on as we are going through each method the in order they are invoked.

```
constructor(props){
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      message: 'hello world',
    } // this is our initial data
  }
```
