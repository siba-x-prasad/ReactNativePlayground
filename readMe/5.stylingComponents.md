# Styles

- Use **rn-css** library

## Width & Height

- Using fexed width and height

```
  <View
        style={{
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
          backgroundColor: 'skyblue',
        }}
      />
```

- **By using Flex**
- It looks like linear layout in android with percentage

```
<View style={{flex: 1}}>
      <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'}} />
    </View>
  );
```

- **Percentage Dimensions**

```
<View
        style={{
          height: '15%',
          backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
        }}
      />
      <View
        style={{
          width: '66%',
          height: '35%',
          backgroundColor: 'skyblue',
        }}
      />
```

## [Layout with FLex box](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox)

```
<View
      style={[
        styles.container,
        {
          // Try setting `flexDirection` to `"row"`.
          flexDirection: 'column',
        },
      ]}>
      <View style={{flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'red'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'darkorange'}} />
      <View style={{flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'green'}} />
    </View>
```

## Flex DIrection

- column (default value)
- row
- column-reverse (Arrange items from Bottom to top)
- row-reverse (Arrange Items from right to left)

## Layout Direction

- **LTR** (default value) Text and children are laid out from left to right. Margin and padding applied to the start of an element are applied on the left side.
- **RTL** Text and children are laid out from right to left. Margin and padding applied to the start of an element are applied on the right side.

## Justify Content

- justifyContent describes how to align children within the main axis of their container.
- For example, you can use this property to center a child horizontally within a container with flexDirection set to row or vertically within a container with flexDirection set to column.
- **flex-start(default value)** Align children of a container to the start of the container's main axis.
- **flex-end** Align children of a container to the end of the container's main axis.

- **center** Align children of a container in the center of the container's main axis.

- **space-between** Evenly space off children across the container's main axis, distributing the remaining space between the children.

- **space-around** Evenly space off children across the container's main axis, distributing the remaining space around the children. Compared to space-between, using space-around will result in space being distributed to the beginning of the first child and end of the last child.

- **space-evenly** Evenly distribute children within the alignment container along the main axis. The spacing between each pair of adjacent items, the main-start edge and the first item, and the main-end edge and the last item, are all exactly the same.

## Align Items

- alignItems describes how to align children along the cross axis of their container.
- It is very similar to justifyContent but instead of applying to the main axis, alignItems applies to the cross axis.

- **stretch (default value)** Stretch children of a container to match the height of the container's cross axis.

- **flex-start** Align children of a container to the start of the container's cross axis.

- **flex-end** Align children of a container to the end of the container's cross axis.

- **center** Align children of a container in the center of the container's cross axis.

- **baseline** Align children of a container along a common baseline. Individual children can be set to be the reference baseline for their parents.

## Align Self

- alignSelf has the same options and effect as alignItems but instead of affecting the children within a container, you can apply this property to a single child to change its alignment within its parent.

## Align Content

- alignContent defines the distribution of lines along the cross-axis. This only has effect when items are wrapped to multiple lines using flexWrap.

- **flex-start** (default value) Align wrapped lines to the start of the container's cross axis.

- **flex-end** Align wrapped lines to the end of the container's cross axis.

- **stretch** (default value when using Yoga on the web) Stretch wrapped lines to match the height of the container's cross axis.

- **center** Align wrapped lines in the center of the container's cross axis.

- **space-between** Evenly space wrapped lines across the container's cross axis, distributing the remaining space between the lines.

- **space-around** Evenly space wrapped lines across the container's cross axis, distributing the remaining space around the lines. Compared to space-between, using space-around will result in space being distributed to the beginning of the first line and the end of the last line.

## Flex Wrap

- The flexWrap property is set on containers and it controls what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main axis.
- By default, children are forced into a single line (which can shrink elements).
- If wrapping is allowed, items are wrapped into multiple lines along the main axis if needed.

## Flex Basis

## Grow

## Shrink

## Row Gap, Column Gap and Gap

- **rowGap** sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's rows.

- **columnGap** sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an element's columns.

- **gap** sets the size of the gap (gutter) between rows and columns. It is a shorthand for rowGap and columnGap.

## Width and Height

- The width property specifies the width of an element's content area. Similarly, the height property specifies the height of an element's content area.

- Both width and height can take the following values:
- **auto (default value)** React Native calculates the width/height for the element based on its content, whether that is other children, text, or an image.

- **pixels** Defines the width/height in absolute pixels. Depending on other styles set on the component, this may or may not be the final dimension of the node.

- **percentage** Defines the width or height in percentage of its parent's width or height, respectively.

## Absolute & Relative Layout

- **relative (default value)** By default, an element is positioned relatively. This means an element is positioned according to the normal flow of the layout, and then offset relative to that position based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any sibling or parent elements.

- **absolute** When positioned absolutely, an element doesn't take part in the normal layout flow. It is instead laid out independent of its siblings. The position is determined based on the top, right, bottom, and left values.

## [Image](https://reactnative.dev/docs/images)

```
<Image
  source={{uri: 'app_icon'}}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>

<Image
  source={{uri: 'asset:/app_icon.png'}}
  style={{width: 40, height: 40}}
/>
```

- Image from network

```
// GOOD
<Image source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}}
       style={{width: 400, height: 400}} />

// BAD
<Image source={{uri: 'https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png'}} />
```

## [Color](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors)

- React supports rgba, hex, color name
