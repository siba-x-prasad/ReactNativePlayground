# State Management And Redux

- There are two types of data that control a component:
- props : props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component.
- state : For data that is going to change, we have to use state.

## useState

- React Native provides a built-in way to manage state using the useState hook for functional components and this.setState for class components.
- This method is ideal for simple state management within individual components.

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const CounterApp = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default CounterApp;
```

## useContext

- For managing state across multiple components, React Native offers the Context API.
- It allows you to share state without passing props down manually through every level of the component tree.

```
import React, { createContext, useState, useContext } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const CountContext = createContext();

const CountProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
};

const Counter = () => {
  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CountContext);
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <CountProvider>
    <Counter />
  </CountProvider>
);

export default App;
```

## Redux

- Redux is a popular library for managing state in React and React Native applications.
- It provides a predictable state container and ensures that state changes are traceable and manageable.
- Redux is ideal for larger applications with complex state logic.
- Install Redux and React-Redux:

```
npm install redux react-redux
```

- Create a Redux Store:

```
import { createStore } from 'redux';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

- Create React Components and Connect to Redux:

```
import React from 'react';
import { Provider, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import store from './store'; // Import your store

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })} />
    </View>
  );
};

const App = () => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Counter />
  </Provider>
);

export default App;
```
